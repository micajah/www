    <H2>Datacenter Consulting</H2>

    <p>Don&#39;t put yourself in a position to have the developer pointing at the hoster and 

        the hoster pointing at the developers.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is typical if they are 

        not the same people. We consult and manage from the datacenter, to the servers, 

        all the way to the application, for projects we are engaged.&nbsp; We don&#39;t need 

        to point fingers, we vertically control the service from bare metal hardware all 

        the way up.  </p>
